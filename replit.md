# AngoCloud - Cloud Storage Platform

## Overview

AngoCloud is a cloud storage platform designed to provide secure and accessible file storage for Angolan users. The application offers tiered storage plans, starting with 20GB of free storage, with paid tiers extending to unlimited enterprise storage. It features a modern interface with file management capabilities, including upload, download, organization, sharing, and trash recovery. The platform prioritizes resilience, client-side encryption, and scalability, supporting multiple deployment environments and robust handling of external dependencies.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language (Português).

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

AngoCloud's frontend is built with React 18+ and TypeScript, utilizing Vite for fast builds and Wouter for lightweight client-side routing. Styling is handled with TailwindCSS v4 and custom design tokens. State management uses React Query for server state and React Context API for authentication. The UI features Shadcn/ui components based on Radix UI, enhanced with custom components, Framer Motion for animations, and Lucide React for iconography. A design system with custom fonts, CSS variables for theming, and responsive breakpoints ensures a modern and consistent user experience. Client-side AES-256-GCM encryption with PBKDF2 key derivation provides zero-knowledge privacy, where files are encrypted in the browser before upload and decrypted on download. Sharing of encrypted files involves key sharing and automatic revocation.

### Backend Architecture

The backend is an Express.js application running on Node.js, using session-based authentication with `express-session` and `connect-pg-simple` for PostgreSQL session storage. Authentication is managed by Passport.js with a LocalStrategy and SHA-256 password hashing. Multer middleware handles file uploads up to 2GB. The core innovation lies in using the Telegram Bot API as the underlying, cost-effective storage backend, distributing load across multiple Telegram bots. The API is RESTful, uses JSON, and includes middleware for logging and error handling. It implements a robust retry mechanism with exponential backoff and jitter, automatic fallback between bots with health checks, and intelligent handling of Telegram rate limits, ensuring high availability and resilience.

### Data Storage

PostgreSQL, provided by Neon serverless database, is used for data storage. Drizzle ORM facilitates type-safe queries and migrations. The schema includes `users` (with storage quotas), `files` (with metadata and Telegram references, supporting soft delete), `folders` (with public sharing support via `isPublic`, `publicSlug`, `publishedAt`), `shares`, and `payments`. Data relationships enforce referential integrity with cascade deletion and soft delete for trash functionality.

### Public Folders Feature

Users can share folders publicly with customized links (`/p/{slug}`). Public folders display file listings and allow guests to preview media and download files without login. Features:
- Generate unique public links for any folder
- Regenerate links anytime
- View public folder metadata (owner, publish date)
- Browse files and subfolders
- Preview images, videos, and audio
- Download files without authentication
- Encrypted files are excluded from public folders for security

### System Design Choices

The architecture supports scalability through:
- **Multiple Telegram Bots:** Up to 10 bots can be configured to distribute upload capacity and ensure resilience.
- **Database Optimizations:** Recommended PostgreSQL indices for efficient querying of millions of files.
- **Server Scalability:** Options for scaling include increasing Replit resources, or migrating to a distributed architecture with Redis for session caching, message queues for background uploads, and CDNs for popular file downloads.
- **Robust Retry/Fallback System:** Implemented with exponential backoff, bot health checks, and rate limit handling to ensure reliable file operations even during Telegram API issues.
- **Monitoring System:** Comprehensive monitoring with health checks, metrics tracking, quota management, and alerting.
- **Fallback Storage Providers:** Interface ready for Cloudflare R2 and Backblaze B2 as backup storage options.

### Storage Limits

- **Free Storage:** 20GB per user
- **Max File Size:** 2GB per file (Telegram API limit)
- **Upload Limit:** Unlimited uploads (limited by storage quota)

### Monitoring & Alerting

The `server/monitoring.ts` module provides:
- Real-time health checks for all Telegram bots
- Daily quota tracking per user
- Automatic alert generation for system issues
- Admin API endpoints for monitoring dashboard
- Error rate tracking and trend analysis

### WebSocket Real-Time Features

The platform includes a WebSocket server (`server/websocket.ts`) for real-time updates in production:
- File upload/delete/restore notifications
- Folder creation/deletion events
- Storage quota updates
- Upgrade request notifications (for admins)
- Share and invitation notifications

**Important:** WebSocket is disabled in development mode to avoid conflicts with Vite's HMR (Hot Module Replacement) WebSocket. The client-side hook (`useWebSocket`) gracefully handles this by silently disabling after a few failed connection attempts.

### Automatic Encryption Toggle for Public Folders

When folders are toggled between public and private, files are automatically processed:

- **Making Public:** All encrypted files are automatically decrypted client-side and re-uploaded to Telegram without encryption. This allows public access to the files.
- **Making Private:** All unencrypted files are automatically encrypted client-side and re-uploaded to Telegram with AES-256-GCM encryption.

**Important:** This process happens in the browser and shows a progress UI. For files larger than 20MB, the reprocessing may fail in Cloudflare Workers due to request size limits. Files uploaded through the chunked upload system maintain their original encryption state when toggling.

### Large File Download (Streaming)

The system supports downloading files up to 2GB through chunked streaming:

**Backend (Cloudflare Workers):**
- `GET /api/files/:id/chunks-info` - Returns chunk metadata (count, sizes, encryption status)
- `GET /api/files/:id/chunk/:index` - Downloads individual chunk by index
- Legacy endpoints (`/download`, `/content`) protected with 50MB limit for chunked files

**Frontend Download Strategy:**
1. **Chrome/Edge Desktop (File System Access API):** True streaming to disk via `showSaveFilePicker()`. Each chunk is written directly to file without accumulating in memory. Best option for large files.

2. **V2 Encrypted Files (Chrome/Edge):** Stream-decrypt each chunk and write directly to disk. No memory limit - supports files up to 2GB.

3. **Other Browsers (Safari, Firefox, Mobile):** Uses Blob accumulation. Browser manages memory by potentially offloading Blobs to disk. Works well for files up to ~1GB.

4. **V1 Encrypted Files (Legacy):** Must be buffered entirely for AES-GCM decryption. Limited by browser memory:
   - Mobile: 200MB max
   - Desktop: 500MB max
   - Files exceeding these limits show error

**Chunk Sizes:**
- Upload: 10MB per chunk (within Telegram's 50MB limit, allows for encryption overhead)
- Download from Telegram: 19MB per chunk (within Telegram's 20MB limit)

### Admin Maintenance Endpoints

- `POST /api/admin/cleanup-expired-sessions` - Clean expired upload sessions and orphan chunks
- `GET /api/admin/expired-sessions-stats` - View statistics on expired sessions

### Known Limitations

- **Telegram Dependency:** Primary storage relies on Telegram Bot API. Monitor ToS changes and prepare Cloudflare R2 fallback.
- **Single Instance:** Current architecture assumes single server instance. Multi-instance scaling requires shared session/quota storage.
- **WebSocket in Development:** Real-time WebSocket features are disabled in development mode due to Vite HMR conflicts. Test real-time features in production builds.
- **Cloudflare Workers Reprocess Limit:** File reprocessing (for encryption toggle) is limited to 20MB per file due to Cloudflare Workers request size limits. Larger files maintain their original encryption state.
- **V1 Encrypted Large Files:** Legacy V1 encrypted files over 200MB (mobile) or 500MB (desktop) cannot be downloaded due to AES-GCM requiring full-buffer decryption. New files use V2 per-chunk encryption which has no memory limit.
- **Mobile Browser Streaming:** iOS Safari and most mobile browsers don't support File System Access API, so large file downloads use Blob accumulation which may exhaust memory for files over ~1GB.

## Recent Changes

### November 30, 2025 - Session Timeout and Inactivity Detection

Implemented automatic session timeout after 10 minutes of inactivity:

**Server-side (Express):**
- Session configured with `maxAge: 10 * 60 * 1000` (10 minutes)
- `rolling: true` to extend session on each request
- New `/api/auth/keepalive` endpoint that explicitly calls `req.session.touch()` and `req.session.save()` to ensure session extension

**Client-side (React):**
- `useInactivityTimeout` hook monitors user activity (mouse, keyboard, scroll, touch)
- Warning modal appears 1 minute before session expires
- "Continuar conectado" button calls `/api/auth/keepalive` to extend session
- If session already expired on server, user is redirected to login with `?expired=true`
- Login page shows session expired message when redirected

**Files modified:**
- `server/routes.ts` - Session config and keepalive endpoint
- `client/src/hooks/useInactivityTimeout.ts` - Inactivity detection hook
- `client/src/components/InactivityWarningModal.tsx` - Warning modal component
- `client/src/App.tsx` - InactivityHandler wrapper
- `client/src/pages/login.tsx` - Session expired message

### November 30, 2025 - System Routes and API Parity

Added comprehensive system routes to the Cloudflare Worker for complete API parity:

1. **GET /api/plans** - Returns available storage plans (public)
2. **GET /api/user/quota** - Returns user storage quota and limits (authenticated)
3. **GET /api/system/limits** - Returns system limits (file size, storage) (public)
4. **GET /api/system/telegram-status** - Returns Telegram bots status (authenticated)
5. **GET /api/stats** - Returns system statistics (user/file counts) (public)
6. **POST /api/shared/files/:fileId/clone** - Clone a shared file to user's own storage (authenticated)

### November 30, 2025 - Invitation Routes Sync

Fixed missing routes in Cloudflare Worker for invitation management:

1. **GET /api/invitations/resource/:type/:id** - Lists invitations for a specific folder or file
2. **PATCH /api/invitations/:id/role** - Updates invitation role/permission

**Note on Cloudflare Workers Statelessness:** 
Daily quota tracking and real-time bot health metrics are simplified in the Worker environment compared to Express, as Workers are stateless. The Worker provides:
- Static system limits (matching Express LIMITS config)
- Bot availability status (based on configured tokens)
- Storage quotas from database (lifetime counts, not daily)

**Note on LSP Errors:**
LSP errors in `cloudflare/worker/routes/*.ts` are due to drizzle-orm version differences between the main project and Cloudflare package. These are type-checking warnings only and don't affect runtime functionality.
